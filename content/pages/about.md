I am a graduate of the University of Michigan, and I work as an Administrative Assistant and Murals of La Jolla Liaison at the Athenaeum Music & Arts Library. I have Bachelor of Arts degrees in Art & Design and Screen Arts & Cultures, with an emphasis in French & Francophone Studies. Although I am focusing right now on my administrative work, I would like to eventually go back to school and earn a graduate degree. I would also like to find work experience as a camera operator or cinematographer on a student or independent film. I currently make my own short videos and have experience in event videography.

In my free time, I like to explore San Diego and work on my photography portfolio. One of my favorite San Diego activities has been volunteering for the San Diego International Film Festival. There, I helped coordinate the event photographers and was able to also add to my own photography portfolio!

#### Programming Languages

#### Digital Imagining / Graphic Design
+ I am skilled with the Adobe Suite, and I have worked as a graphic designer at Rolling Design â€“ a design company in Shenzhen.
